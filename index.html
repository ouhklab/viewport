Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU), formerly The Open University of Hong Kong, is not only a provider of quality higher education, but also a well-managed self-financing entity. Over the past three decades, HKMU has evolved from primarily a distance learning institution to become a comprehensive university providing full-time undergraduate and postgraduate programmes as well as part-time programmes. Through nurturing talent to meet our society's needs, we have made longstanding contributions to the advancement of Hong Kong's economy. Today, we are the largest self-financing university in Hong Kong, grooming more than 130,000 graduates and ranks sixth among local universities in terms of full-time undergraduate number.
